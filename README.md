# Noughts-Crosses
I've created a simple, classic Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This nostalgic game allows two players to take turns marking 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win! ðŸŽ®
